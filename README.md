# Maths Magicians
In this project, I will be creating a *Math Magicians* repo. This will be done by first creating a feature branch then add a **README.md** file. Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:
- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote. The project will have a .gitignore file to ignore all unneccesary files together with two files for HTML and CSS.
